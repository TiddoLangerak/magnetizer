- Make sure only one compilation runs at the same time
- Check what happens during branch switching
- Fix less (both that it works and that watchers are set correctly)
- Cache source map meuk

- Optimize incremental build.
	Currently the slowest parts are:
	* GatherFiles. This is likely due to `resolve` being slow. We can likely optimize this by doing some caching.
	* compat source maps. We can likely optimize this by caching & parallalization
